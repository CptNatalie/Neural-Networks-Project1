# Neural Networks Project 1
A machine learning project focused on predicting student loan risk using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset with various features related to students' financial situations, academic backgrounds, and career goals to train a neural network model capable of assessing the risk associated with student loans.

## Challenges

* Data Privacy and Security: Protecting sensitive financial and personal information is paramount.
* Bias and Fairness: Addressing potential biases in the data to make fair and equitable loan risk predictions.
* Dynamic Loan Terms and Regulations: Keeping the model updated with the latest loan terms and regulations.
* Individual Circumstances and Future Uncertainties: Accounting for the variability in students' future financial situations.
